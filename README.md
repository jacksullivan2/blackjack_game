This project has the aim to build a BlackJack game to be played in the terminal window. The purpose of this game is to practise using classes (OO Programming), 
functions, and other parts of python that I have learned during my gap year prior to my Data Science studies. 

I have created a Database on my MySQL sever called blackjack, and inside a 'games' table within this is where I have stored information about the result of each hand.
